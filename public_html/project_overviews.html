Related tasks for the team include business relations, securing the sponsorship, event planning, budgeting and strategic cost management.

Fashion designers upload their designs, people vote for their favorites, then only the top designs go into production and displayed on the e-commerce website. Bridging the gap between designers and shoppers, Modatrova serves as a platform for designers and customers to optimize the fashion experience.

									This venture is backed by the $2 billion investment announced on June 18th, 2014 by Governor McAuliffe and widely reported by national media and local newspapers. Tranlin started with a team of most capable and entrepreneurial professional managers and is striving to bring the innovative technology and eco-friendly products to the U.S. market. The project team will work closely with the experienced management team of Darden alumni. Specific tasks will be discussed with the client; potentially these include in-depth case studies on top brands of pulp paper products and identifying the potential partners Tranlin could benefit from in entering the US paper product and organic fertilizer markets.

									Westminster Canterbury of the Blue Ridge (WCBR) is a local assisted living center seeking to work with seniors to help them write their stories in a way that can connect them either to each other or to the community. One of the first steps of the project team would be to meet with a select handful of residents so they can help think through how to make the storytelling and writing processes the easiest for residents, and to pilot the VIA Character Strengths assessment tool. This is an incredible opportunity to gain experience in building a social venture/business from the ground up.

									WORK | RELEASE is an arts venue, exhibition and events space located in the historic Texaco building in the NEON District in Downtown Norfolk, Virginia (workreleasenorfolk.com).

The business is having issues with pricing, customers, and sales. This is more of a traditional consulting project with an opportunity to see immediate impact within the business.
